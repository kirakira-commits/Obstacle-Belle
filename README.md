MingCheng mutated and now it's raining down on you! Enjoy the second game in the series of "The MingCheng Games"
Due to B****'s insistance, the latest compatible versions will not include names, and only the v0.1 will contain belle.png (may needed package: panda3d. run this in terminal:) brew install panda3d If you don't have HomeBrew, shame on you! Are you even a real developer? If you are, you probably know what is HomeBrew, so I'm not going to leave a guide.
